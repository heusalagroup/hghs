HG HomeServer will some day be a subset of Matrix.org HomeServer written in pure TypeScript.

It will support a small set of Matrix.org protocol that our software products use.

### Start the server in development mode

FIXME: This isn't working right now. Use production mode.

```
npm start
```

### Build the server

```
npm run build
```

### Start the server in production mode

```
npm run start-prod
```

...and open http://0.0.0.0:3000
